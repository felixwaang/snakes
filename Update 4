# My journey on python was a rather long and tough one. I had to 
# read through 36 sections fo the python to understand all the python commands
# as it's different to C commands.
#
# This journey was a fun one, but I will not stop there.
# I feel like doing every activity that involved coding up to the Mandelbrot
# Set is a great way to start of my python journey. I still have lots to learn
# and I will try master this language as a "bilingual" person in coding is
# much better than monolingual one.
#
# If you'd like to keep following my python journey, feel free.
# Whenever I have spare time, I definitely will try extra codes in python
# as it is a pretty cool language to learn!
# 
# I'd like to thank Python for the system and my friend, Sean, for teaching
# me basics and everything python can use and can be added onto python like
# numpy and stuff. 
#
# I might try attempt the other tasks when I have free time
