Hi, I'll be updating this repository of cool python code I learn to program!

Welcome to my journey in learning Python.

You can click any .py file to see my code I have conjured up for that activity.
Updates is just notes to myself in a blog fashion to remind me what I've learnt
and to update anyone who cares.

Feel free to browse any of the code I wrote!
