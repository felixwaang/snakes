I've completed everything in and upto module 3.

Python is a lot harder than I anticipated, everyone says after C, python is easy; not the case.
I've learnt for, I haven't even learnt this in C yet...

Getting used to this programming takes effort, because not only is syntax different, the way
to present ideas is also different.

How do people learn multiple languages without getting them confused sometimes?

OH, and I realised that I like C more than python because in C you can compile files,
whereas in python it's like a windows and you type in code... Need to save that code onto
github.

Finished my first "assignment" for python, I'll do more in order for me to learn python!
