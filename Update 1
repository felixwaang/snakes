What I've learnt so far:

I've learnt about the print function which is similar to C.

I've learnt about strings early on for example:
word = 'Python'
word[1] = y
word[:2] = Py
'S' + word[1:6] = Sython
etc...

Also learnt about the string length function:
s = 'ilovedhavingstevenandberniceastutors'
len(s) = 36

Taught me about lists ie:
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
If I call the function squares, it'll give me the list.
You can also concatenate lists like squares + [49, 64, 81].

First proper python code I learnt was:
>>> #Prints out the fibonaci sequence
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while b < 10:
...     print(b)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
